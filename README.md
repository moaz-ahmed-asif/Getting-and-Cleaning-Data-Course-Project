# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a [Md. Moaz Ahmed Asif](https://github.com/moaz-ahmed-asif) submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset:

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Files:

    1. CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
    
    2. run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
        a. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        b. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        c. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        d. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
        e. From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    3. FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
